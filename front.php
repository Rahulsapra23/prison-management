	   <div class="desc1">To maintain the records of the prisoner and the various cases registered against them are part of the work of the Jail authority. In fact, Jail    authorities are maintaining approximately 40 registers to maintain the details of the prisoners. Also, as per the Jail manual there is provision of granting remission to the prisoners. The remission is granted at the various levels. To calculate remission, the probable date of release, the amounts of sentences granted by the court are maintained at the Jail. Also, identification of the prisoner at the time of release is also a major concern of the Jail authority.<br>
The PMS s/w captures all the details of the prisoner along with the photo and the thumb impressions of the prisoner. Thus, eliminating any chance of impersonation.</div>
